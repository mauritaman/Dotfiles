This is the group that composed the entire soundtrack to The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. Koji Kondo is perhaps the most recognizable name from the bunch, simply because he is the man responsible for such musical accomplishments as the Super Mario, Zelda and Star Fox soundtracks many Nintendo fans have grown up with. The others have worked on several other Nintendo projects, most notably the other Zelda games.
