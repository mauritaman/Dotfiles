Michael Bennett's 1975 tale of Broadway's gypsies--the chorus dancers--resonated with audiences as few shows ever have, examining with both hilarity and heartbreak the grueling life of ordinary performers always auditioning for an opportunity to be members of a faceless chorus line. Along the way, it picked up the Pulitzer Prize, the New York Drama Critics Award, and nine Tony awards, and became the longest-running show in Broadway history at the time (now surpassed by Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera"). The original cast (eight of whom contributed their real-life memories to the show) included no major stars, but are unmatched on this cast recording of Marvin Hamlisch and Edward Kleban's score, including Priscilla Lopez's poignant "Nothing," Donna McKechnie's yearning dance number "The Music and the Mirror," one of Broadway's most famous torch ballads in "What I Did for Love," and the ultimate high-kicking chorus number, "One." Fans of the show will welcome the 1998 remastered CD, which adds two and a half minutes to "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love." While still incomplete, the montage now includes "Four-foot ten," "Little brat," and "The worst thing in school...."
